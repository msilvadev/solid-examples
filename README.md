# SOLID Code Examples


    S — Single Responsiblity Principle
    O — Open-Closed Principle
    L — Liskov Substitution Principle
    I — Interface Segregation Principle
    D — Dependency Inversion Principle


### [Single Responsiblity Principle](src/srp/CourseSrpProblem.java)

    A class must have only one reason to exist and should execute only one thing.

### [Open-Closed Principle](src/ocp/VideoOcpProblem.java)

    A class must be **open** for extension but **closed** for modification.

### [Liskov Substitution Principle](src/lsp)

    Subclasses can be replaced by their parent classes.

### [Interface Segregation Principle](src/isp)

    A class is not required to implement an interface that it will not use.

### [Dependency Inversion Principle](src/dip)

    Rely on abstractions rather than implementation.
    Invert the dependencies
