    S — Single Responsiblity Principle
    O — Open-Closed Principle
    L — Liskov Substitution Principle
    I — Interface Segregation Principle
    D — Dependency Inversion Principle


### [Single Responsiblity Principle](src/srp/CourseSrpProblem.java)

A class must have only one reason to exist and should execute only one thing.

### [Open-Closed Principle](src/ocp/VideoOcpProblem.java)

A class must be **open** for extension but **closed** for modification.

### [Liskov Substitution Principle](src/lsp)

Subclasses can be replaced by their parent classes.
